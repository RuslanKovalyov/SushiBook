        <h3>Caring for Maple Wood
        </h3>

        <p>
            Though durable, untreated Maple wood requires specific care to maintain its longevity. Hand-wash only with a mild washing up liquid, and warm water. For wood cutting boards, you should use a quaternary ammonium sanitizer Rub dry thoroughly with a clean
            cloth to prevent water marks. Treat the wood regularly by rubbing in a little mineral oil.
        </p>

        <h3>Plastic cutting boards
        </h3>
        <p>
            Are easier to sanitize. But cutting on them also leaves lots of grooves where bacteria can hide. For plastic cutting boards, you should use a chlorine-based sanitize.
        </p>

        <h3>When To Replace
        </h3>
        <p>
            At some point, scrubbing and sanitizing might not be enough. When your cutting board has accumulated a lot of deep grooves from repeated use, you probably need to replace it. The more grooves it has, and the bigger they are, the more area is available
            for trapping moisture and giving bacteria a place to proliferate.
